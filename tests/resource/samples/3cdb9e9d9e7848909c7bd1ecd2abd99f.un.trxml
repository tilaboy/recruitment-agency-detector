   A new Finance Director opportunity for a SME in Southern Derbyshire, where you will be working with the owners of the business and overseeing a small team.

   This will the the first Finance Director the business has had as it moves into it's next phase of growth, so there is a real opportunity to make the role your own and develop the function. You will oversee a small team, but still be hands on, looking after a group structure which includes the main business interests as well as a significant property portfolio.

   You will be looking to improve the systems and processes, create more insight from the numbers, develop the board packs, provide more insightful forecasts, and improve the management information as a whole.

   You will want to take ownership of the job costings, want to get involved in the business and like the challenge of implementing better controls but not get phased to be in an environment which isn't particularly structured yet.

   Sound like you?

   Ideally you will be fully qualified, but it isn't a prerequisite if your experience is a great match. Ideally you will have experience of contracting, but again, this isn't a deal-breaker.

   However, you do need to have the right personality and approach, where you can engage your team and the wider business as well as be confident in raising any issues or improvements you can see with the owners and be a problem solver when needed.

   In return you will be in a business that rewards your positive input and has significant potential along with some interesting projects, such as the development of new offices.
