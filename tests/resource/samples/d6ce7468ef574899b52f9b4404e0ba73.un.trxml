   Project Engineer - Industrial Controls Background - Permanent - North Staffordshire - c.GBP35-40k DOE + profit related bonus

   Samuel Frank Associates have been instructed by a North Staffordshire based system integrator to find a new addition for their engineering team. We're looking for a Project Engineer who has experience of PLC /SCADA software who has the aptitude and desire to want to develop into a Project Manager.

   This opportunity could suit someone with 4-8 years' experience, however all relevant applications will be considered.

   Key responsibilities of the Project Engineer include -

   * Ensure that the client' system is designed fit-for-purpose and adheres to the user specification, project budget and schedule

   * All aspects of the Project Lifecycle from specification (URS, FDS, SDS) through to commissioning and final project documentation.

   * Production of project documentation including Functional Design Specifications, Project Specific Drawings, Design Risk Assessments, Test Procedures, Operator / Maintenance manuals and training manuals

   * System configuration, including PLC and SCADA configurations to meet project requirements

   * Demonstrable experience of PLCs, Siemens TIA Portal, SIMATIC S7-400 &amp; S7-300 would be extremely useful for the position

   The client is a small &amp; very well-established system integrator. Their customers are predominantly based in the North of England and Wales, so any site work will involve short term visits rather than spending weeks/months away at a time.

   They have customers in various sectors including chemical, water and steel so they're not tied to one industry; giving them opportunities to expand in growing industries if one sector they operate in slows up.

   This opportunity will suit a capable Project Engineer who is comfortable dealing face to face with customers and has the ability to deliver small to medium size projects from start to finish.</Value></Field>
