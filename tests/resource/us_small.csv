  Client Description:

  One thing we know is that this client, as big as it is, is still setting the standard for not only the product they're turning out, but for the way they conduct business.

  Our client is the global leader in technology, with offices in many major cities. As different as those cities are, you can expect that the personality of each office is the same. Commonalities include bringing people together in the physical work space, outlets for creativity (outside work-related exercises), and a setup for brainstorming on the fly, whenever the opportunity strikes.

  What they see in your resume, if you're selected, is your ability to be an autonomous thinker, and a team player; someone focused, and driven to push the envelope who can also let down their guard and have fun with the team while doing it; someone who has the intellectual capacity to challenge even the most innovative thinkers without the hubris that tends to accompany it. No egos here!

  Here, everyone is considered a project owner, and expected to give 100%, even when the path forward isn't necessarily clear.

  Work here, and know you're working with a Forbes #1 rated company.

  Work here, and know you're setting the pace for digital products globally.

  Work here, and find the challenge of your career!

  And in case you're afraid you won't have time for other things, you'll be able to take advantage of:
  * Fitness center access
  * Discounts on things like dry cleaning and oil changes
  * Free lunches
  * Convenient commuter shuttles",cc84cf72232245adb8215c287a51b004,yes,http://aquent.com/find-work/151393,aquent.com,feederscript

  Specialty:
  Operating Room
  Job Description / Responsibilities:
  RNs working in the operating room assist doctors and surgeons in the operating room and monitor patients' vital signs during surgery. They work alongside surgical teams to ensure that patients receive the best possible care and serve as liaisons between the surgical team and the patients' families. OR nurses also assess patients before surgery, coordinate surgical care, and maintain a sterile operating room. Because emergency surgeries can arise at any moment, many OR positions require that nurses take call during weekends and holidays, especially if the OR RN is working at a trauma center. Candidates for OR nursing jobs should be multifaceted, organized, and strong patient advocates. OR travel nurses earn above average salaries, full benefits packages, and are in high demand.
  Job Skills / Requirements:
  * Valid BLS and ACLS from the American Heart Association
  * A valid professional license within the state of practice
  * Certified Nurse Operating Room (CNOR) credential is recommended and may be required for specific registered nurses and travel nurse positions
  * Specialty-related certifications are preferred and may be required for specific positions
  * Proof of right to work in the United States
  * Experience as an OR nurse

  Job Salary & Benefits:

  Skilled perioperative travel nurses are highly sought after in medical facilities across the US. Travelers typically earn higher compensation than staff nurses -- along with all the flexibility that comes with traveling. Operating Room nurse salary depends on years of experience, regional salary trends, duties performed and additional certifications. Traveling OR nurses can increase their compensation with additional hours and overtime if available. Benefits such as insurance, travel reimbursement and housing allowances further increase OR travel nurse pay. Additional certifications such as CNOR will expand your options and eligibility for the highest-paying OR positions.
