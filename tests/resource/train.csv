   Salary: £38,000 OTE (18k basic + uncapped commission) plus company car, first year earning circa. 45k

   Please note it is essential to have a driving licence for this role

   Introduction

   One of our priorities has always been to reflect our diverse customer community with an equally diverse group of employees. In 2017, we set ourselves the aim of operating with a gender equal team by 2025.

   We're excited to launch our latest campaign - #levellingthefield - as we continue forward on this journey, opening up more opportunities in our Field Sales Advisor team. Our female workforce is less represented in this area, that's why we are reaching out to females who are looking for a new challenge and inviting them to apply.

   To be clear, we welcome applications from everyone, not just females. Click apply if you're interested, we'd love to hear from you!

   The Role

   So, what is a Field Sales Advisor? They're the people who work door to door and sell our services to people in their homes. On an average day you'll be knocking on around 150-200 doors.

   People might not always be interested in our products straight away, which means you'll need to gain their trust by asking the right questions and find out what they're looking for. You'll be delightfully surprising when building connections with customers, adding a thoughtful touch to every conversation.

   We'll give you a territory to work in, which means you just need to plan your routes, hit the road and start spreading some Virgin Media magic. If you are a confident, persuasive person, you'll be a great fit for this challenging role! #thiswomancansell

   Who we're looking for

   You don't need to have experience selling tech products - you'll be given comprehensive training in the role when you join, and of course you'll have ongoing support from day one. You can trust us to do the right thing by you.

   To be a success, you'll need:
     * A full, manual, valid UK driving license
     * Strong communication skills, resilience, and the ability to have great conversations
     * Confidence, and a friendly personality to connect with potential customers
     * To be comfortable working outside, always in motion and in all weathers
     * A flexible approach to work. This isn't a 9-5 role; you'll probably get your best results outside of office hours, often later in the afternoon or the evening when our customers are at home

   You'll be doing this in all weathers come rain or shine, and of course, we'll provide you with a car and company branded clothing suitable for all weathers. You'll also have all our products and prices right at your fingertips to help people make the right choice for them.

   What's in it for you

   Meet your targets and you'll enjoy one of the best commission structures around as well as lots of additional incentives and rewards.

   We'll provide all the tools you need to do the job including a company vehicle, branded clothing, and tablet. You'll be rewarded with spectacular benefits too.

   See below for a full list of benefits, including:
     * Buy or sell extra holiday days on top of your 25 days holiday allowance
     * Mates rates on Virgin Media products

   Things to consider before you apply

   Before you apply, please take a moment to ensure you are happy with the advertised salary above.

   This role will require you to travel within an hour's radius of the advertised location. In submitting your application, you agree you that you are happy with this information and would like our recruitment team to review your application accordingly.

   Virgin Media is part of Liberty Global, the world's biggest cable company. We are delivering the biggest investment in the UK's digital infrastructure for over a decade. Through four multi-award-winning services - Virgin Fibre, Virgin TV, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Phone - we help people access technology to build connections that really matter.

What's more you'll also benefit from discounts across Virgin Media products and Virgin brands and many other perks on top."

Why should you apply?

   We have an excellent mix of people and some of our best account managers joined us with no experience. So, if you've never worked in sales or construction, that's fine with us. Success at Hilti is down to teamwork and ability, no matter what your background.

What you need is:

     * Retail Sales/Technical/Sales background

     * Dynamic, proactive person with the ability to effectively develop customer relationships
     * Understand the business reasons behind our strategy and link it to daily work e.g. Fleet Management
     * Effective and efficient multi-tasking ability to ensure best possible service is given to the customers.

   Flexible working is one of many ways that Hilti seeks to ensure that it offers a work-life balance that works for employees and works for the business. We offer flexible working options to suit different stages in your life and aim to support you to find the right balance between work and home life.

   Flexible working can take many forms, including but not limited to: job sharing, part-time working, annualised hours, compressed hours, flexi-time, term-time working, working from home, staggered hours, career breaks, time off in lieu, and flexible shift-working*. We also offer employees the option to buy up to five extra days' annual leave each year.

   *Please note that not all options are available for every role and you must complete six months' service before you are eligible for any change in your working pattern.

   ""How am I going to sell power tools? I've never drilled a hole in my life! That's what I thought when I first joined Hilti, but it's really not like that. It's about nurturing your strengths and being rewarded for hard work.""

   Born in 2001 with just a handful of developers, we are now over 900 employees strong across 7 group offices worldwide with our headquarters in Central London. Over 24 million players enjoy our 258 games, generating on average 6,028 chat messages every 15 minutes!

Visit our reception - you'll find sweets and a giant monkey, in the design team a giant red lamp and the latest quad core mac pros; the breakout areas a Gamesys pool table and fridges full of beer, wine and soft drinks. In the meeting rooms you might find grass instead of carpet, in the summer you'll meet all our families together for a celebration and in the winter you can find Mexican wrestlers or circus acts roaming around. Weekly social and sports events give you the opportunity to stretch both your mind and body, whether it be getting involved in a meetup or brownbag session, playing in the poker tournament or joining one of the many sports teams. But our culture is not just in what you can see it's in everything we do, we're hard workers and we get stuck in.

   We have fun, making fun and our vision is to invent, play and discover together, to craft experiences that thrill our players and rock the world.

JOB DESCRIPTION

   Let me tell you a story about 23 year old Abbie from South London. She achieved excellent A Level results before moving on to one of the best universities in the country.

   Abbie graduated in 2017 and contacted Horizon Teachers to apply for a full-time Graduate Teaching Assistant position in a Secondary School to start in September.

   Abbie was enthusiastic and passionate about education when she met us. She wanted to apply for a PGCE straight after university but wanted to gain in school experience before committing. We also advised Abbie that this was the best option at her stage of her career as it would also support her application.

   We had been contacted by Abbie in June, and within two weeks she had been offered Graduate Teaching Assistant roles in two local Secondary schools. She had attended interviews at these schools that had been arranged by Horizon Teachers. The same enthusiasm and passion that was clear when she met us also shone in her interviews.

   After considering both options, Abbie chose an Outstanding school within 30 minutes commute of her home. The school had offered her a Graduate Teaching Assistant position within the Science Department for the entire academic year. Science was what she had studied at university and what she was passionate about. It's safe to say Abbie was over the moon.

   After 6 months in the position, Abbie was offered to complete teacher training by the school. Abbie had expressed an interest in teaching and the school were very keen for her to stay on. Abbie had also received several offers to complete her PGCE at university. Her applications had been supported by her experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.

   In the end, Abbie decided to complete a PGCE at university as this was the route into teaching she had always wanted go down. She is now training to become a Science Teacher.

   We have kept in contact with Abbie and she is so thankful for our help in finding her a Graduate Teaching Assistant job. She says that the experience has proved valuable in her journey to becoming a teacher. Once Abbie has completed her PGCE we will also be helping to find her first teaching job.

The Role

   Business as usual is no longer enough - it's time to break the mould.

   At Cundall, we do things differently - we are committed to providing people with the knowledge, skills and enthusiasm to make a difference: in our homes, our offices, our projects, our industry and our community.

   We are the world's first consultancy to be formally endorsed as a One Planet Company by sustainability charity BioRegional, and our Australian team is a JUST organisation.

   Over the years, we have delivered many exemplar green buildings and have built up an international sustainable design expertise that is second to none.

   If you are passionate about becoming an agent of change for a sustainable world, and want to be a part of our mission to create fantastic built environments that positively impact our communities, we want to hear from you.

   Your Responsibilities

   As an integral part of our quickly growing Melbourne team, you will play a key role in driving our projects and our teams to industry leading sustainable development outcomes.

   Reporting to the Melbourne ESD Team Lead, you will also play an important role in developing our existing team - sharing knowledge, assisting in training outcomes, and setting a high standard for others to aspire to.

   You will have the opportunity to lead projects relevant to your existing level of experience, be strongly supported to expand our portfolio and be a leading project manager both in our Melbourne office and our Australia-wide Sustainability team.

   The potential exists, either immediately or in the near future, to become involved in financial, resourcing and training coordination, with appropriate support.

   So if projects like the Burwood Brickworks, Younghusband wool stores or the many others in our portfolio appeal to you, join us!

   About you

   You will have a passion and commitment for leading projects and developments in the sustainable building industry in Australia and globally.

   You're able to motivate and inspire others whilst responding positively to new challenges, and thrive in a position ideally suited to someone seeking a diverse and evolving pipeline of work.

   And of course, you will be focused on growing your own career and reputation at an exciting time for our industry.

   Your skills will include:

     * Education to degree level in Engineering, the Built Environment or a related area, and significant and broad-ranging experience in a sustainability consulting role.
     * The ability to lead projects and junior staff and represent the business positively to design teams and client organizations.
     * Clear, positive and engaging communication skills.
     * Practical experience in the application of rating tools such as Green Star, NABERS, WELL, Living Building Challenge etc.
     * Knowledge of common modelling software and protocols (valuable but not essential), particularly IES VE, Grasshopper, AutoCAD etc.
     * Broad based experience in sustainability consulting, preferably including skillsets such as planning advice, climate adaptation planning, life cycle analysis, energy auditing etc."

   At Cox Automotive the Manheim Auction business has 17 locations, each with it's own complexities, diverse demographics and competitors.

   They met some fabulous team members along the way who are passionate and work exceptionally hard to deliver a great experience for both our customers and our candidates.

   Salary: £38,000 OTE (18k basic + uncapped commission) plus company car, first year earning circa. 45k

   Please note it is essential to have a driving licence for this role

   Introduction

   One of our priorities has always been to reflect our diverse customer community with an equally diverse group of employees. In 2017, we set ourselves the aim of operating with a gender equal team by 2025.

   We're excited to launch our latest campaign - #levellingthefield - as we continue forward on this journey, opening up more opportunities in our Field Sales Advisor team. Our female workforce is less represented in this area, that's why we are reaching out to females who are looking for a new challenge and inviting them to apply.

   To be clear, we welcome applications from everyone, not just females. Click apply if you're interested, we'd love to hear from you!

   The Role

   So, what is a Field Sales Advisor? They're the people who work door to door and sell our services to people in their homes. On an average day you'll be knocking on around 150-200 doors.

   People might not always be interested in our products straight away, which means you'll need to gain their trust by asking the right questions and find out what they're looking for. You'll be delightfully surprising when building connections with customers, adding a thoughtful touch to every conversation.

   We'll give you a territory to work in, which means you just need to plan your routes, hit the road and start spreading some Virgin Media magic. If you are a confident, persuasive person, you'll be a great fit for this challenging role! #thiswomancansell

   Who we're looking for

   You don't need to have experience selling tech products - you'll be given comprehensive training in the role when you join, and of course you'll have ongoing support from day one. You can trust us to do the right thing by you.

   To be a success, you'll need:
     * A full, manual, valid UK driving license
     * Strong communication skills, resilience, and the ability to have great conversations
     * Confidence, and a friendly personality to connect with potential customers
     * To be comfortable working outside, always in motion and in all weathers
     * A flexible approach to work. This isn't a 9-5 role; you'll probably get your best results outside of office hours, often later in the afternoon or the evening when our customers are at home

   You'll be doing this in all weathers come rain or shine, and of course, we'll provide you with a car and company branded clothing suitable for all weathers. You'll also have all our products and prices right at your fingertips to help people make the right choice for them.

   What's in it for you

   Meet your targets and you'll enjoy one of the best commission structures around as well as lots of additional incentives and rewards.

   We'll provide all the tools you need to do the job including a company vehicle, branded clothing, and tablet. You'll be rewarded with spectacular benefits too.

   See below for a full list of benefits, including:
     * Buy or sell extra holiday days on top of your 25 days holiday allowance
     * Mates rates on Virgin Media products

   Things to consider before you apply

   Before you apply, please take a moment to ensure you are happy with the advertised salary above.

   This role will require you to travel within an hour's radius of the advertised location. In submitting your application, you agree you that you are happy with this information and would like our recruitment team to review your application accordingly.

   Virgin Media is part of Liberty Global, the world's biggest cable company. We are delivering the biggest investment in the UK's digital infrastructure for over a decade. Through four multi-award-winning services - Virgin Fibre, Virgin TV, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Phone - we help people access technology to build connections that really matter.

   Our benefits are your reward for being brilliant. They're pretty darn spectacular. Just like our people. We've put together a package to help you love what you do, at work and at play. You will get 25 days holiday and your birthday off each year, we provide a company funded Medical Plan as well as a Pension Plan where we will match every pound you put in, up to 10%. What's more you'll also benefit from discounts across Virgin Media products and Virgin brands and many other perks on top."

   UK
   Reference No: 10279

What's the role?

   We're looking for talented individuals who combine a Masters or MBA education with sales experience in an international environment to accelerate their career with us, demonstrating excellent results and benefitting from the training and development required to achieve a director-level position within 12 to 18 months.
   You will have the opportunity to work on some of the UK's biggest construction projects whilst at the same time receiving world-class training and development to take your career to the next level. You need to be able to hit the ground running in a fast-paced, high-performing, international working culture.

Who is Hilti?

   If you're new to the industry, you might not have heard of us. We provide leading-edge tools, technologies, software and services for the global construction sector. We have a proud heritage, built over 75 years, and a worldwide reputation for pioneering products and exceptional service. With some 28,000 people in more than 120 countries, which we're looking to expand, we're a great place for you to show us your worth, step up to new challenges and grow your career.

What does the role involve?

   Following substantial growth and investment in the past years, Hilti (Great Britain) Ltd. currently employs circa 1,000 employees, of which approximately 50% are in sales related positions. You will learn the business as a Regional Manager, a commercial leadership position with a focus on operational and strategic business in your designated region, combined with people management.

   As a Regional Manager, you'll be expected to meet and exceed business targets, plus maximise profitable growth in your region. This means partnering with our customers to understand their businesses, while developing loyal, win-win relationships. It also involves working with other management teams to capitalize on business potential across territories, and taking an active role in handling key accounts. You'll lead a team of 7-10 Account Managers, which calls for training, developing and motivating them, both individually and as a unit. In fact, we'll measure you as much on developing your team as on achieving your targets.

   You will also benefit from dedicated mentoring from senior leaders within the organisation and a bespoke career plan to allow you to reach your full potential in the organisation, whether that is in the UK or internationally
   Hilti Great Britain is proud to rank 35th in the Sunday Times Top 100 Best Companies to work for 2019.

What do we offer?

   Your responsibilities will be great and, with them, we'll give you the freedom and autonomy to do whatever it takes to deliver outstanding results. Go beyond our expectations and we'll reward you with unrivalled opportunities for personal development and career progression as soon as you're ready for the next challenge.

Why should you apply?

   We have an excellent mix of people, which we believe makes for a more vibrant, more innovative, more productive team. So, if you've never worked in construction, that's fine with us. Success at Hilti is down to teamwork, ability and competitive drive, no matter what your background.

What you need is:

     * Masters or MBA
     * Sales experience in an international environment, with the ability to inspire others and achieve results
     * Clear leadership experience plus proven ability to influence at board/senior management level
     * Strong conceptual and analytical skills with a strategic mind-set
     * Entrepreneurial mind-set with strong interpersonal and communication skills
     * International mobility
     * Fluency in an additional language preferred
     * You are attracted to the Hilti culture, which is very down-to-earth with a strong balance between performance drive and people orientation
     * As part of your interview process, we'll take you on a day-in-the-life 'field ride' to give you a feel for our business and the calibre of our people.

   Flexible working is one of many ways that Hilti seeks to ensure that it offers a work-life balance that works for employees and works for the business. We offer flexible working options to suit different stages in your life and aim to support you to find the right balance between work and home life.

   Flexible working can take many forms, including but not limited to: job sharing, part-time working, annualised hours, compressed hours, flexi-time, term-time working, working from home, staggered hours, career breaks, time off in lieu, and flexible shift-working*. We also offer employees the option to buy up to five extra days' annual leave each year.

   *Please note that not all options are available for every role and you must complete six months' service before you are eligible for any change in your working pattern.

   ""How am I going to sell power tools? I've never drilled a hole in my life! That's what I thought when I first joined Hilti, but it's really not like that. It's about nurturing your strengths and being rewarded for hard work.""

You will also secure all evidence found and will work with the relevant authorities, including the police to help secure convictions if necessary.
