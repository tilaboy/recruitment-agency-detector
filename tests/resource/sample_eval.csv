   Fantastic customer care is at the heart of everything we do, and as a Trainee Pharmacy Advisor you'll be part of helping patients feel good. It's everything from the clear advice and care you offer them, to the wide ranges of dispensing services we provide.

   Within Boots we have Trainee Pharmacy Advisors and this is sometimes known as a Trainee Dispenser. To provide fantastic patient care as a Trainee Pharmacy Advisor you will work across the healthcare counter and the dispensary to where the patients need you most.

   This is a great opportunity to develop your pharmacy career and make a difference to the lives of our patients.

   How will you do it?

   With different types of pharmacies all over the UK, we're giving patients the very best care and attention with the services we offer. You will be learning how to provide healthy lifestyle advice and health services to our patients through great conversations as well as delivering the technical aspects of supplying medicines.

   This is often a fast paced environment, and you will interact with many different people, and will be a core member of the pharmacy and healthcare team.

   What you'll be doing day to day

   It's all about providing health advice through focussed conversations with our patients, whilst giving clear and accurate answers.

   Your duties will include:
     * Learning how to tailor conversations with every customer to ensure they leave your pharmacy feeling informed and confident about their healthcare needs

   We're offering you an exciting career opportunity and a chance to continue your professional journey. You will need to be prepared to work towards an NVQ Level 2 equivalent in Pharmacy Services to join us.

   But it isn't just about experience or knowledge, we're looking for people with a genuine passion for customer care, and who will be ambassadors for healthcare in our stores. You will have the ability to build strong relationships with patients and your team, and will be able to understand individual patient needs and tailor your support and advice appropriately. You will have the ability to advise patients with confidence and accuracy whilst remaining customer focussed.

   If you are interested in further developing your professional career, we can support you towards achieving both competency and knowledge based NVQ Level 3 (QCF) Pharmacy Services qualification to become eligible to register with the GPhc as a Pharmacy Technician. This could then lead to an Accuracy Checking Pharmacy Technician (ACPT) role. As you continue to develop your healthcare knowledge through these qualifications and roles, your pay and benefits will reflect this.

   Excitingly, this is just one of several routes your career could take you within Boots!"

Recruitment fraud and scam alert

   Qatar Airways is proud to be an employer of choice for many candidates from around the world. However, there are unscrupulous individuals who look to take advantage of this. Qatar Airways never charges applicants for interviews, security deposits, or for placement. If you are asked for money as part of any Qatar Airways recruitment, please do not pay and then submit a report by clicking here with all accompanying e-mails and documents. Note that this link should not be used for purposes other than reporting suspected fraud and any other requests will be ignored.

   Alternatively, if you wish to contact Qatar Airways for other purposes, please visit our contact us page by clicking here.

How can you tell if a recruitment communication comes from Qatar Airways?

   1) All e-mails should be from a Qatar Airways Domain (@qatarairways.com.qa or @.<>.qatarairways.com).

   2) Have you been interviewed by Qatar Airways? All applicants are interviewed prior to offer, Face to Face, Video, or Telephone, at a minimum.

   3) Is the visa process being dealt with through the On-Boarding Zone, and at zero cost to you? This is how Qatar Airways handles visas.

   4) If it is an expatriate role, is it in Qatar or the GCC? We rarely hire expatriates in other markets.

   Again, we appreciate your interest in a career with Qatar Airways, and wish you the best of luck in your recruitment process.
