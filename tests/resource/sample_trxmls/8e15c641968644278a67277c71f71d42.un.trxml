Job Description:

   Reporting to the CTO, the Head of Software Engineering will lead and manage the application development and software engineering teams.

   In the last few years, the business has executed upon a strategy of building a leading global technology business, and during this time it has grown dramatically. All software engineering and development functions have been in-sourced to establish software engineering as a core competence and a source of innovation. The older and proprietary systems and platforms have been replaced with modern open, flexible and automated approaches.

   The in-house software development teams have also grown dramatically and require an experienced Head of Software Engineering to lead the team and continue to develop an industry-leading software engineering capability. This will include management of a team of around 50 in-house developers and testers and the direction of a number of partner-provided team members when extra temporary development capacity is required.

   What you'll be doing

     * Building, operating and leading the software engineering capability, and a leading set of processes and tooling, whilst also being knowledgeable about how to introduce changes to ways-of-working whilst still continuing to deliver effectively.
     * Line management and personnel development of the team, encouraging development of a multi-skilled team as appropriate.
     * Ensuring quality is being engineered in from the start rather than assured at the end, and active management of any technical debt accumulated.
     * Working with the CTO and other team leads to define the target technical, systems and software architectures, and the strategy to deliver towards that end.
     * Develop a strong partnership with the Product Management team.
     * Leading collaboration with the platforms and infrastructure team, IT service and support teams and other to actively coordinate cross team activities, and to assist each other and respond to incidents.
     * Making budgetary reports and recommendations to the CTO as appropriate to existing and planned application development and software engineering initiatives.
     * Coordinating developers' contributions to Open Source projects where needed.
     * As a Process Owner in relation to GDPR, accountable for following the Privacy Impact Assessments Procedure for every in-scope project or change, for adhering to the Privacy by Default Guidelines, and adhering to your role in the Incident Management Procedure.
     * Fulfil obligations as a Contract Owner as outlined in the clients Data Privacy Manual.
       About you
     * You have unparalleled communications skills and can work well within an organization to get things done.
     * You like to be hands-on and can roll up your sleeves in day to day work as well as leading strategy and architecture.
     * You can win the hearts and minds of the developers, gaining their respect.
     * Team player, able to provide guidance to a multifunctional team.
     * Experience of fast-moving and growing organisations in the online space, preferably with experience of multi-channel and retail organisations
     * As a trusted collaborator, you will bring your subject matter expertise to bear to influence business strategy so technology considerations and assessments become integral to our strategic planning processes.
     * You enjoy an entrepreneurial atmosphere and have experience of scaling up an enterprise to significant organization size and revenues.
     * You are customer obsessed and puts the voice of the customer at the heart of everything you do.
     * Ideally you will have gone through and love the challenges of high growth and scalability challenges of a start-up or smaller company but also have some experience at a larger company.
     * Ability to build and lead a world-class engineering team. You will need to recruit and retain great talent and would want to bring developers on board with whom you have worked with previously.
     * People development - This clients' growth gives great opportunity for personal and career development for all, and so it's important you are capable at developing and mentoring others.
     * Self-motivated, capable of working with limited supervision, pro-actively reporting on status and tasks.
     * Adaptable - the role requires a willingness to take on tasks outside of a narrowly defined role, and ideally a desire to be multi-skilled.
       Key Skills:
     * Excellence in application development and software engineering processes and approaches, in particular Agile and Lean methodologies, continuous integration and delivery/deployment, TDD and XP.
     * Expertise in application development and software engineering personally, with strong credibility and mindshare with senior developers and engineers.
     * Intellectually capable and passionate about technology, but also pragmatic and commercially-savvy. Able to work both strategically and tactically as required for the growth of the business and the development of the Engineering capabilities, and a robust operation.
     * Energetic, can do approach to delivering targets and objectives
     * Strong line and man management skills, motivation, talent development and establishing and maintaining community.
     * Experience with any of the languages and frameworks we are using for development is clearly an advantage, but fundamentally the Head of Software Engineering should be agnostic about languages, frameworks and software tools, instead preferring to choose the most appropriate tool for each job, whilst still leaning towards R&amp;D with newer approaches and frameworks where practical.
