   Do you take pride in your code?

   Looking to build on the foundations you already have set in place?

   My client are looking for a self-motivated Full-Stack Developer with attention to detail to join their growing yet well-established company.

   You will be required to understand and contribute to your team's product protocol, whilst following and enforcing quality software practice and processes within the team. You will be working across the full development lifecycle, gaining deep knowledge of the product whilst using a broad modern technology stack.

   Required Skills:

   *C# &amp; .NET Framework
   *ASP.NET MVC &amp; Web API
   *HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   *Databases e.g. SQL Server / RavenDB

   Desirable Knowledge:

   *Software Design Patterns
   *SOLID Design Principles
   *Object Oriented Programming
   *Asynchronous Programming
